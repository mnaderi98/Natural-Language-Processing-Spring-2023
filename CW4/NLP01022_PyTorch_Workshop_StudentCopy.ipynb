Waiting our whole training corpus to be processed before making an update is constly. On the other hand, updating the parameters after every training example causes the loss to be less stable between updates. To combat these issues, we instead update our parameters after training on a batch of data. This allows us to get a better estimate of the gradient of the global loss. In this section, we will learn how to structure our data into batches using the `torch.util.data.DataLoader` class. \n","\n","We will be calling the `DataLoader` class as follows: `DataLoader(data, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True, collate_fn=collate_fn)`.  The `batch_size` parameter determines the number of examples per batch. In every epoch, we will be iterating over all the batches using the `DataLoader`. The order of batches is deterministic by default, but we can ask `DataLoader` to shuffle the batches by setting the `shuffle` parameter to `True`. This way we ensure that we don't encounter a bad batch multiple times.\n","\n","If provided, `DataLoader` passes the batches it prepares to the `collate_fn`. We can write a custom function to pass to the `collate_fn` parameter in order to print stats about our batch or perform extra processing. In our case, we will use the `collate_fn` to:\n","1. Window pad our train sentences.\n","2. Convert the words in the training examples to indices.\n","3. Pad the training examples so that all the sentences and labels have the same length. Similarly, we also need to pad the labels. This creates an issue because when calculating the loss, we need to know the actual number of words in a given example. We will also keep track of this number in the function we pass to the `collate_fn` parameter.\n","\n","Because our version of the `collate_fn` function will need to access to our `word_to_ix` dictionary (so that it can turn words into indices), we will make use of the `partial` function in `Python`, which passes the parameters we give to the function we pass it.
